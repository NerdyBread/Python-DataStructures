# Python-DataStructures

## What is it?

This repository contains simple implementations of data structures written in Python3.

The goal is to give a starting point for people looking to learn data structures.

As of now it contains:

* Stack
* Queue
* HashTable
* Linked List

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute by adding a data structure or modifying one:

* Make a pull request
* If you added a new data structure, make sure to add it to the list in the readme

Any contribution is appreciated :)

## Format

Generally each file will be formatted about the same.

There will usually be:
* An explaination of the data structure
* The python implementation
* And example usage
* Error checking and things like that are not necessary, but feel free to add it

## Requests

If there is a data structure you want to see added, create an issue labeled inhancement and I will (try to) implement it.
